# Introduction

Generate 'molecular CVs' of common chemical properties

## Notes

- For Lilly MedChem rules, the Lilly code rejects some atoms without providing a demerit number.
  - My code gives these all demerits of `default_demerits` and sets their status to `Hard reject`.
  - Molecules with demerit scores are given a status of `Reject`
  - Molecules which pass are given a status of `Pass`

## Data sets used

- logD and LogP from [RTlogD](https://github.com/WangYitian123/RTlogD)
